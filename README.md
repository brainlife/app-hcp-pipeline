# app-hcp-pipeline

This App is a Brainlife wrapper for [HCP Pipelines](https://github.com/Washington-University/HCPpipelines). The HCP Pipelines product is a set of tools for processing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images for the [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectome.org/). In particular, this App implements the structural preprocessing, and uses the [BIDS-app wrapper](https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/HCPPipelines), which consists of a container that includes all of the dependencies and a run script that parses a BIDS dataset (this is the reason why the latest version of this App may not correspond to the latest released version of the HCP Pipelines).

## Running the App 

### On Brainlife.io

Check out the brainlife app [here](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.465)

### Running Locally

Information on how to run HCP Pipelines locally can be found here:
https://github.com/Washington-University/HCPpipelines/wiki/Installation-and-Usage-Instructions

### Inputs

The structural prepocessing is subdivided into 3 parts (Pre-FreeSurfer processing, FreeSurfer processing, and Post-FreeSurfer processing), and requires at least one T1w and one T2w scan. If you input a freesurfer folder (optional), the FreeSurfer step will be skipped.

### Outputs

A folder containing all the outputs.

### Dependencies

This App requires [singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/) to run. If you don't have singularity, you will need to install following dependencies. It also requires [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
